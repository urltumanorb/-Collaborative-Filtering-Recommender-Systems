# Collaborative-Filtering-Recommender-Systems
## What is the project?
This project is a lab that implementing collaborative filtering to build a recommender system for movies. In this lab, we can learn knowledge about collaborative filtering learning algorithm.

## Concepts
### Collaborative filtering
Collaborative filtering is a technique used by recommender systems. It recommends items based on similarity measures between users and/or items. The basic assumption behind the algorithm is that users with similar interests have common preferences.

### Recommendation system
A recommendation system is an artificial intelligence or AI algorithm, usually associated with machine learning, that uses Big Data to suggest or recommend additional products to consumers.

## Which programing language and packages did I use?
### Language
Python - It is a high-level, general-purpose language. It has concise and expressive syntax, as well as a powerful standard library. It is suitable for various application development domains, including web development, data science, artificial intelligence, and more. In this procject, I used python to accomplish some mechine learning work.

### Packages
numpy - It is the fundamental package for scientific computing with Python.

tensorflow - It is a popular platform for machine learning.
```
import numpy as np
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras
from recsys_utils import *
```

## Dataset
In this lab, we use the matrices x, w and b
